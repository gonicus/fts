If you need to create a debian package of the current GIT tree, please
call the "package.sh" script. This one creates the .orig.tar.gz, the
debian.tar.gz and the .dsc files. Additionally it leaves the unpacked
source like you're know it from "apt-get source foo", etc.

If you have no sbuild or related service, you may want to call something
like

  dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -rfakeroot

inside of the create source directory (i.e. fts-1.0) in order to
build the packages. After the build, they're placed in the directory
where this README file is located.
